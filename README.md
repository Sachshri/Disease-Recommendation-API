# Disease Recommendation API

The Disease Recommendation API helps users identify potential diseases based on the symptoms they provide. The API utilizes a machine learning model to analyze the symptoms and returns three key pieces of information:

- **`disease`**: The most likely disease that matches the given symptoms.
- **`doctor_type`**: The type of doctor recommended for further consultation.
- **`disease_description`**: A brief description of the identified disease, including common symptoms and potential treatment options.

## How to Use the API

To use this API, send a JSON object in the request body where each key represents a symptom, and the values as array of binary (1 if the symptom is present, 0 if absent).The array size for each symptom must be same.
If user want to know the disease related to more than one set of symptoms we have used array.
For Example: The size of array (as value) of each symptom (as key) is 3 in user request than the binary value at first position of each symptom array corresponds to the same set of symptoms related to one disease and similar for all other.
**Example Request:**
```json
{
    "highfever": [1,0,0],
    "cough": [1,1,0],
    "headache": [1,0,1],
....
